**Machine learning is the sub-field of computer science that gives "Computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed"**

### Major machine learning techniques

- **Regression/Estimation**: Predicting continuous values for example predicting price of house based on its characteristics or to estimate the Co2 emission from a carâ€™s engine.

- **Classification**: Technique are used to predicting a class or category of the case for example if a cell is benign or malignant.

- **Clustering**: Finding the group of structure of data for example customer segmentation in banking field.

- **Associations**: Associating frequent co-occurring items/events for example grocery items that are usually bought together by a particular customer.

- **Anomaly detection**: Discovering abnormal and unusual case for example detecting credit card fraud.

- **Sequence mining**: Predicting next events for example click stream in websites.

- **Dimension reduction**: Reducing the size of the data.

- **Recommendation systems**: Recommendation systems for example this associates people's preferences with others who have similar tastes, and recommends new items to them, such as books or movies.

### Difference between AI, ML, DL

- **AI**: Artificial Intelligence is general field with a broad scope including: Computer Vision, Language Processing, Creativity and Summarization.

- **ML**: Machine Learning is the branch of AI that covers the statistical part of artificial intelligence. It teaches the computer to solve problems be looking ar hundreds & thousands of examples, learning from them, and then using that same experience to solve same problems in new situations.

- **DL**: Deep Learning is a very special field of machine learning where computers can actually learn and make intelligent decisions on their own.
