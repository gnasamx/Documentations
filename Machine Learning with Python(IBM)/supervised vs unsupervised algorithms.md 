The biggest difference between supervised, and unsupervised learning is that supervised learning deals with 
labeled data while unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data. In supervised learning, we have machine 
learning algorithms for classification, and regression. In unsupervised learning, we have methods such as 
clustering.In comparison to supervised learning, unsupervised learning has fewer models, and fewer evaluation
methods that can be used to ensure that the outcome of the model is accurate.
