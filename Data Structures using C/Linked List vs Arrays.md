### :link: Linked List vs :bullettrain_front: Arrays

An array is linear collection of data elements and a linked list is a linear collection of nodes. But unlike an array, a linked list does not store its nodes in consecutive memory locations. Another point of difference between array and a linked list is that a linked list does not allow random access of data. Nodes in a linked list can be accessed only in a sequential manner. But like an array, insertions and deletions can be done at any point in the list in a constant time.

Another advantage of linked list over an array is that we can add any number of elements in the list. This is not possible in case of an array. For example, if we declare an array as `int marks[10]`, then the array can store a maximum of 10 data elements, but not event one more than that. There is no such restriction in case of a linked list.

Thus, linked list provide an efficient way of storing related data and perform basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and updating of information at the cost of extra space required for storing the address of next nodes.
